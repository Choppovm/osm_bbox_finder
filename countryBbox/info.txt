Saved what would've been literal hours trying to get good enough bounding box data for each country.

The preFullName/ folder conists of the json data before it was merged.
Originally, the data was just the country code with the coordinates.
The new data contains the full country name, which helps avoid needing to translate it all later.

json2dbScraper.py takes all of the information in bboxValues.json and puts it in the SQLite database.
